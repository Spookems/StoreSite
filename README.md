# StoreSite
Simple ASP.NET Core Application demonstrating a simple online store. Utilises bootstrap, JQuery, AJAX JQuery, SQL Server and a few smaller technologies. 

This application is a test bed for features I find interesting / have a utility for in work in some way, as it stands its a somewhat competent .NET core application 
with plans to grow it significantly over the next 6 months (1st June onwards).
